## Pin connections

This reader uses SPI bus.

| Pololu SD reader | Arduino | Description |
|------------------|---------|-------------|
| DI               | 11      | SD reader data in (MOSI) |
| DO               | 12      | SD reader data out (MISO) |
| SCLK             | 13      | Clock |
| CS               | Any, i.e. 4 | Chip select |

### Note on SPI

Source: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI](https://www.arduino.cc/en/reference/SPI)

Master device is, usually, a microcontroller (i.e. Arduino).

- MISO - Master in, Slave out - used by slave device to send data to master device
- MOSI - Master out, Slave in - used by master device to send data to slave device
- SCK - Serial Clock - used to synchronize data transmission. Is generated by master.
- SS - Slave Select - the pin on each device that the master can use to enable and disable specific devices. If slave device reads LOW on this pin, it communicates with the master. If it's HIGH, it ignores all the communication.

Arduino Pins:

| Board | MOSI | MISO | SCK | SS |
|-------|------|------|-----|----|
| Pro Mini | 11   | 12   | 13  | configurable by the SD library, might be 4 |
